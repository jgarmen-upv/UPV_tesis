  title    = {Search for high energy cosmic muon neutrinos from variable gamma-ray sources and time calibration of the optical modules of the {ANTARES} telescope},
  year     = {2015},
  abstract = {Since the first evidence of the existence of cosmic rays (c. 1910) and the first hints of a new ghost particle later on named "neutrino"' (c. 1920) has passed a century. During this time, many experiments and theoretical ideas have expanded our knowledge about the most fundamental particle physics and the most extreme astrophysical processes in the Universe. One of these ideas was proposed half a century ago: neutrino telescopes, the feasibility of which has been proven during the last decade. They aim to provide a crucial contribution to the understanding of the physical processes hosted in the many astrophysical objects by the detection of high energy neutrinos. Eventually, they may provide an answer to the origin of the cosmic rays. It has been during the last years that they provided the first evidence of the existence of high energy cosmic neutrinos. This work represents an effort in this direction. In this thesis, multiple analyses have been performed using data of the ANTARES neutrino telescope in order to look for correlations of high energy neutrinos with known gamma-ray astrophysical sources. The ones that have been studied in this work are Active Galactic Nuclei, X-Ray Binaries and the Crab Pulsar Wind Nebula. In addition to the coincidence in space of neutrinos coming from these sources, it has been used the time information expected from their photon emissions at high energies (X-rays and gamma-rays). This reduces substantially the background and therefore the amount of signal required for a discovery in these point source analyses. In parallel, this work also included the improvement of the time calibration procedure for the ANTARES detector. The structure of this manuscript is as follows. First, the physics involved and the justification of the neutrino candidate sources are introduced in chapter 1. Then, the detection principle of neutrino astronomy and the state of the art about neutrino telescopes are presented. In chapter 2, the ANTARES neutrino telescope is described. Performance and simulations are reported in chapter 3. Chapter 4 is devoted to the time calibration of the detector. In particular, the operation of the controlled pulse light devices (optical beacons) and the analysis of their data are described. Its performance along the time has been evaluated and the success of the automation of the processes means a valuable asset for this crucial task in a neutrino telescope, useful for present and future detectors. In chapter 5 the astronomy at X-ray energies and above are described, introducing the telescopes used to obtain the time information of the photon emissions of the candidate sources analysed here. Their characterisation and the definition of the flare periods are also covered. These analyses are based on an extended maximum likelihood ratio technique, which is described in detail in chapter 6 together with the optimisation procedures. Finally, the application of this technique to the analysed sources and the results derived from it are presented in chapter 7, where conclusions and limits on neutrino fluxes are discussed. The analysis of the obtained data have provided strong constrains and also reinforce of IceCube ones regarding possible cosmic neutrino sources. Among the possible analyses that can be performed, the one presented in this work seeks to detect neutrino emission from known promising astrophysical sources improving the analysis performance by the expected time-dependant bond of the signal. This way, the proof of hadronic processes that would link cosmic ray production with them would be find or constrained otherwise.},

  abstract   = {This is a review of neutrino astronomy anchored to the observational fact that Nature accelerates protons and photons to energies in excess of 1020 and 1013 eV, respectively. Although the discovery of cosmic rays dates back close to a century, we do not know how and where they are accelerated. There is evidence that the highest-energy cosmic rays are extra-galactic - they cannot be contained by our galaxy's magnetic field anyway because their gyroradius far exceeds its dimension. Elementary elementary-particle physics dictates a universal upper limit on their energy of 5×1019 eV, the so-called Greisen-Kuzmin-Zatsepin cutoff; however, particles in excess of this energy have been observed by all experiments, adding one more puzzle to the cosmic ray mystery. Mystery is fertile ground for progress: we will review the facts as well as the speculations about the sources. There is a realistic hope that the oldest problem in astronomy will be resolved soon by ambitious experimentation: air shower arrays of 104 km2 area, arrays of air Cerenkov detectors and, the subject of this review, kilometre-scale neutrino observatories. We will review why cosmic accelerators are also expected to be cosmic beam dumps producing associated high-energy photon and neutrino beams. We will work in detail through an example of a cosmic beam dump, γ-ray bursts (GRBs). These are expected to produce neutrinos from MeV to EeV energy by a variety of mechanisms. We will also discuss active galaxies and GUT-scale remnants, two other classes of sources speculated to be associated with the highest-energy cosmic rays. GRBs and active galaxies are also the sources of the highest-energy γ-rays, with emission observed up to 20 TeV, possibly higher. The important conclusion is that, independently of the specific blueprint of the source, it takes a kilometre-scale neutrino observatory to detect the neutrino beam associated with the highest-energy cosmic rays and γ-rays. We also briefly review the ongoing efforts to commission such instrumentation.},

  abstract  = {Astrophysical neutrinos can be produced in proton interactions of charged cosmic rays with ambient photon or baryonic fields. Cosmic rays are observed in balloon, satellite and air shower experiments every day, from below 109 eV up to macroscopic energies of 1021 eV. The observation of different photon fields has been done ever since, today with detections ranging from radio wavelengths up to very high-energy photons in the TeV range. The leading question for neutrino astronomers is now which sources provide a combination of efficient proton acceleration with sufficiently high photon fields or baryonic targets at the same time in order to produce a neutrino flux that is high enough to exceed the background of atmospheric neutrinos. There are only two confirmed astrophysical neutrino sources up to today: the sun and SuperNova 1987A emit and emitted neutrinos at MeV energies. The aim of large underground Cherenkov telescopes like IceCube and KM3NeT is the detection of neutrinos at energies above 100 GeV. In this paper, recent developments of neutrino flux modeling for the most promising extragalactic sources, gamma ray bursts and active galactic nuclei, are presented.},

  abstract  = {Fully updated for the second edition, this book introduces the growing and dynamic field of particle astrophysics. It provides an overview of high-energy nuclei, photons and neutrinos, including their origins, their propagation in the cosmos, their detection on Earth and their relation to each other. Coverage is expanded to include new content on high energy physics, the propagation of protons and nuclei in cosmic background radiation, neutrino astronomy, high-energy and ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, sources and acceleration mechanisms, and atmospheric muons and neutrinos. Readers are able to master the fundamentals of particle astrophysics within the context of the most recent developments in the field. This book will benefit graduate students and established researchers alike, equipping them with the knowledge and tools needed to design and interpret their own experiments and, ultimately, to address a number of questions concerning the nature and origins of cosmic particles that have arisen in recent research.},

  abstract = {Neutrino astrophysics offers new perspectives on the Universe investigation: high-energy neutrinos, produced by the most energetic phenomena in our Galaxy and in the Universe, carry complementary (if not exclusive) information about the cosmos with respect to photons. While the small interaction cross section of neutrinos allows them to come from the core of astrophysical objects, it is also a drawback, as their detection requires a large target mass. This is why it is convenient to put huge cosmic neutrino detectors in natural locations, like deep underwater or under-ice sites. In order to supply for such extremely hostile environmental conditions, new frontier technologies are under development. The aim of this work is to review the motivations for high-energy neutrino astrophysics, the present status of experimental results and the technologies used in underwater/ice Cherenkov experiments, with a special focus on the efforts for the construction of a km3-scale detector in the Mediterranean Sea.},

One string of 60 sensors buried in the ice and a surface array of eight ice Cherenkov tanks took data until December 2005 when deployment of the next set of strings and tanks began. We have analyzed these data, demonstrating that the performance of the system meets or exceeds design requirements. Times are determined across the whole array to a relative precision of better than 3ns, allowing reconstruction of muon tracks and light bursts in the ice, of air-showers in the surface array and of events seen in coincidence by surface and deep-ice detectors separated by up to 2.5km.},

During the period April, 1996 to July, 2001, Super-Kamiokande I collected 1678 live-days of data, observing neutrinos from the Sun, Earth's atmosphere, and the K2K long-baseline neutrino beam with high efficiency. These data provided crucial information for our current understanding of neutrino oscillations, as well as setting stringent limits on nucleon decay. In this paper, we describe the detector in detail, including its site, configuration, data acquisition equipment, online and offline software, and calibration systems which were used during Super-Kamiokande I.},

  abstract   = {The observation of high-energy extraterrestrial neutrinos is one of the most promising future options to increase our knowledge on non-thermal processes in the universe. Neutrinos are e.g. unavoidably produced in environments where high-energy hadrons collide; in particular, this almost certainly must be true in the astrophysical accelerators of cosmic rays, which thus could be identified unambiguously by sky observations in “neutrino light”. To establish neutrino astronomy beyond the detection of single events, neutrino telescopes of km3 scale are needed. In order to obtain full sky coverage, a corresponding detector in the Mediterranean Sea is required to complement the IceCube experiment currently under construction at the South Pole. The groups pursuing the current neutrino telescope projects in the Mediterranean Sea, ANTARES, NEMO and NESTOR, have joined to prepare this future installation in a 3-year, EU-funded design study named KM3NeT (in the following, this name will also denote the future detector). This report will highlight some of the physics issues to be addressed with KM3NeT and will outline the path towards its realisation, with a focus on the upcoming design study.},

Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer.

  abstract  = {Validation can be used to detect when overfitting starts during supervised training of a neural network; training is then stopped before convergence to avoid the overfitting (“early stopping”). The exact criterion used for validation-based early stopping, however, is usually chosen in an ad-hoc fashion or training is stopped interactively. This trick describes how to select a stopping criterion in a systematic fashion; it is a trick for either speeding learning procedures or improving generalization, whichever is more important in the particular situation. An empirical investigation on multi-layer perceptrons shows that there exists a tradeoff between training time and generalization: From the given mix of 1296 training runs using difierent 12 problems and 24 difierent network architectures I conclude slower stopping criteria allow for small improvements in generalization (here: about 4\% on average), but cost much more training time (here: about factor 4 longer on average).},

  abstract   = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer’s inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a stateof-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

For a deep-sea neutrino telescope, the variability of the environmental conditions that can affect the behaviour of the data acquisition system must be considered, in addition to a reliable description of the active parts of the detector and of the features of physics events, in order to produce a realistic set of simulated events. In this paper, the software tools used to produce neutrino and cosmic ray signatures in the telescope and the strategy developed to represent the time evolution of the natural environment and of the detector efficiency are described.},

  abstract  = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

ANTARES sends alerts after a fast online analysis based on energy and reconstruction direction of track-like events. From December of 2018 until the beginning of 2021, Baikal-GVD received 38 ANTARES alerts, and followed up 32. No coincidence was found. However, a search of the Baikal-GVD cascade sample showed some events falling within an angular distance of less than 5° for three of the ANTARES alerts in a time span of 48 hours. A dedicated offline analysis based on the full ANTARES data sample has been started to search for additional coincident tracks and cascades at a 3σ significance. In this work we present the final results of the offline analysis of the three ANTARES alerts: limits on the astrophysical neutrino fluence are reported.},

The method relies only on signal and background expectations derived from Monte Carlo simulations, so no bias is introduced by looking at actual data, for instance by setting a limit based on expected signal above the “last remaining data event”. After discussing the concept of the “average upper limit”, based on the expectation from an ensemble of repeated experiments with no true signal, we show how the best model rejection potential is achieved by optimising the cuts to minimise the ratio of this average upper limit to the expected signal from the model. As an example, we use this technique to determine the limit sensitivity of kilometre scale neutrino detectors to extra-terrestrial neutrino fluxes from a variety of models, e.g. active galaxies and gamma-ray bursts. We suggest that these model rejection potential optimised limits be used as a standard method of comparing the sensitivity of proposed neutrino detectors.},

The unified treatment solves a problem (apparently not previously recognized) that the choice of upper limit or two-sided intervals leads to intervals which are not confidence intervals if the choice is based on the data. We apply the construction to two related problems which have recently been a battleground between classical and Bayesian statistics: Poisson processes with background and Gaussian errors with a bounded physical region. In contrast with the usual classical construction for upper limits, our construction avoids unphysical confidence intervals. In contrast with some popular Bayesian intervals, our intervals eliminate conservatism (frequentist coverage greater than the stated confidence) in the Gaussian case and reduce it to a level dictated by discreteness in the Poisson case. We generalize the method in order to apply it to analysis of experiments searching for neutrino oscillations. We show that this technique both gives correct coverage and is powerful, while other classical techniques that have been used by neutrino oscillation search experiments fail one or both of these criteria.},

  abstract      = {AMANDA is a high-energy neutrino telescope presently under construction at the geographical South Pole. In the Antarctic summer 1995/96, an array of 80 optical modules (OMs) arranged on 4 strings (AMANDA-B4) was deployed at depths between 1.5 and 2 km. In this paper we describe the design and performance of the AMANDA-B4 prototype, based on data collected between February and November 1996. Monte Carlo simulations of the detector response to down-going atmospheric muon tracks show that the global behavior of the detector is understood. We describe the data analysis method and present first results on atmospheric muon reconstruction and separation of neutrino candidates. The AMANDA array was upgraded with 216 OMs on 6 new strings in 1996/97 (AMANDA-B10), and 122 additional OMs on 3 strings in 1997/98.},

  abstract      = {The main objectives of the KM3NeT Collaboration are (i) the discovery and subsequent observation of high-energy neutrino sources in the Universe and (ii) the determination of the mass hierarchy of neutrinos. These objectives are strongly motivated by two recent important discoveries, namely: (1) the high-energy astrophysical neutrino signal reported by IceCube and (2) the sizable contribution of electron neutrinos to the third neutrino mass eigenstate as reported by Daya Bay, Reno and others. To meet these objectives, the KM3NeT Collaboration plans to build a new Research Infrastructure consisting of a network of deep-sea neutrino telescopes in the Mediterranean Sea. A phased and distributed implementation is pursued which maximises the access to regional funds, the availability of human resources and the synergistic opportunities for the Earth and sea sciences community. Three suitable deep-sea sites are selected, namely off-shore Toulon (France), Capo Passero (Sicily, Italy) and Pylos (Peloponnese, Greece). The infrastructure will consist of three so-called building blocks. A building block comprises 115 strings, each string comprises 18 optical modules and each optical module comprises 31 photo-multiplier tubes. Each building block thus constitutes a three-dimensional array of photo sensors that can be used to detect the Cherenkov light produced by relativistic particles emerging from neutrino interactions. Two building blocks will be sparsely configured to fully explore the IceCube signal with similar instrumented volume, different methodology, improved resolution and complementary field of view, including the galactic plane. One building block will be densely configured to precisely measure atmospheric neutrino oscillations.},

The neutrino selection criteria have been chosen to maximize the selection of possible signals produced by the self-annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles accumulated in the centre of the Sun with respect to the atmospheric background. After data unblinding, the number of neutrinos observed towards the Sun was found to be compatible with background expectations. The 90\% CL upper limits in terms of spin-dependent and spin-independent WIMP-proton cross-sections are derived and compared to predictions of two supersymmetric models, CMSSM and MSSM-7. The ANTARES limits are comparable with those obtained by other neutrino observatories and are more stringent than those obtained by direct search experiments for the spin-dependent WIMP-proton cross-section in the case of hard self-annihilation channels (W+W−, τ+τ−).},

  abstract = {An account is given of the method of extended maximum likelihood. This differs from the standard method of maximum likelihood in that the normalisation of the probability distribution function is allowed to vary. It is thus applicable to problems in which the number of samples obtained is itself a relevant measurement. If the function is such that its size and shape can be independently varied, then the estimates given by the extended method are identical to the standard maximum likelihood estimators, though the errors require care of interpretation. If the function does not have this property, then extended maximum likelihood can give better results.},

  abstract      = {Indirect dark matter detection methods are used to observe the products of dark matter annihilations or decays originating from astrophysical objects where large amounts of dark matter are thought to accumulate. With neutrino telescopes, an excess of neutrinos is searched for in nearby dark matter reservoirs, such as the Sun and the Galactic Centre, which could potentially produce a sizeable flux of Standard Model particles. The KM3NeT infrastructure, currently under construction, comprises the ARCA and ORCA undersea {\v C}erenkov neutrino detectors located at two different sites in the Mediterranean Sea, offshore of Italy and France, respectively. The two detector configurations are optimised for the detection of neutrinos of different energies, enabling the search for dark matter particles with masses ranging from a few GeV/c2 to hundreds of TeV/c2. In this work, searches for dark matter annihilations in the Galactic Centre and the Sun with data samples taken with the first configurations of both detectors are presented. No significant excess over the expected background was found in either of the two analyses. Limits on the velocity-averaged self-annihilation cross section of dark matter particles are computed for five different primary annihilation channels in the Galactic Centre. For the Sun, limits on the spin-dependent and spin-independent scattering cross sections of dark matter with nucleons are given for three annihilation channels.},

We begin by describing the generic expectations for cosmic neutrinos, including the effects of propagation from their sources to the detectors. Then we introduce the operating principles of current neutrino telescopes, and examine the main features (topologies) of the observable events. After a discussion of the main background processes, due to the concomitant presence of secondary particles produced in the terrestrial atmosphere by cosmic rays, we summarize the current status of the observations with astrophysical relevance that have been greatly contributed by IceCube detector. Then, we examine various interpretations of these findings, trying to assess the best candidate sources of cosmic neutrinos. We conclude with a brief perspective on how the field could evolve within a few years.},

PCA belongs to the family of dimension reduction methods and is particularly useful when the data are large (i.e., multiple variables), big (i.e., multiple observations per variable), and highly correlated. The goal is to identify a reduced set of features that represent the original data in a lower-dimensional subspace with minimal loss of information. PCA and related methods provide means to summarize the data and extract information about individual differences. This makes these methods particularly useful in the era of Big Data and personalized medicine. In the first section, we explain the mathematical formula behind PCA. In the second section, we show how to implement the method using a toy example. Finally, in the last section, we discuss some exemplar applications of PCA from the existing literature.},

  abstract = {We investigate particle dynamics that is governed by a nonstandard kinetic action of a special form. We are guided by a phenomenological scheme-the modified dynamics (MOND)-that imputes the mass discrepancy, observed in galactic systems, not to the presence of dark matter, but to a departure from Newtonian dynamics below a certain scale of accelerations, a0. The particle′s equation of motion in a potential φ is derived from an action, S, of the form S ∝ Sk[r(t), a0] − ∫ φ dt. The limit a0 → 0 corresponds to Newtonian dynamics, and there the kinetic action Sk must take the standard form. In the opposite limit, a0 → ∞ we require Sk → 0-and more specifically, for circular orbits Sk ∝ a−10-in order to attain the phenomenological success of MOND. Galilei-invariant such theories must be strongly nonlocal. This is a blessing, as such theories need not suffer from the illnesses that are endemic to higher-derivative theories. We comment on the possibility that such a modified law of motion is an effective theory resulting from the elimination of degrees of freedom pertaining to the universe at large (the near equality a0 ≍ cH0 being a trace of that connection). We derive a general virial relation for bounded trajectories. Exact solutions are obtained for circular orbits, which pertain to rotation curves of disk galaxies. We also explore, in passing, theories that depart from the conventional Newtonian dynamics for very low frequencies.},

  abstract = {Deflection of light by gravity was predicted by General Relativity and observationally confirmed in 1919. In the following decades, various aspects of the gravitational lens effect were explored theoretically. Among them were: the possibility of multiple or ring-like images of background sources, the use of lensing as a gravitational telescope on very faint and distant objects, and the possibility of determining Hubble's constant with lensing. It is only relatively recently, (after the discovery of the first doubly imaged quasar in 1979), that gravitational lensing has became an observational science. Today lensing is a booming part of astrophysics.},

  abstract      = {The Review summarizes much of particle physics and cosmology. Using data from previous editions, plus 3,324 new measurements from 878 papers, we list, evaluate, and average measured properties of gauge bosons and the recently discovered Higgs boson, leptons, quarks, mesons, and baryons. We summarize searches for hypothetical particles such as supersymmetric particles, heavy bosons, axions, dark photons, etc. Particle properties and search limits are listed in Summary Tables. We give numerous tables, figures, formulae, and reviews of topics such as Higgs Boson Physics, Supersymmetry, Grand Unified Theories, Neutrino Mixing, Dark Energy, Dark Matter, Cosmology, Particle Detectors, Colliders, Probability and Statistics. Among the 120 reviews are many that are new or heavily revised, including a new review on High Energy Soft QCD and Diffraction and one on the Determination of CKM Angles from B Hadrons.The Review is divided into two volumes. Volume 1 includes the Summary Tables and 98 review articles. Volume 2 consists of the Particle Listings and contains also 22 reviews that address specific aspects of the data presented in the Listings.The complete Review (both volumes) is published online on the website of the Particle Data Group (pdg.lbl.gov) and in a journal. Volume 1 is available in print as the PDG Book. A Particle Physics Booklet with the Summary Tables and essential tables, figures, and equations from selected review articles is available in print and as a web version optimized for use on phones as well as an Android app.},

  abstract = {There is almost universal agreement among astronomers that most of the mass in the Universe and most of the mass in the Galactic halo is dark. Many lines of reasoning suggest that the dark matter consists of some new, as yet undiscovered, weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). There is now a vast experimental effort being surmounted to detect WIMPs in the halo. The most promising techniques involve direct detection in low-background laboratory detectors and indirect detection through observation of energetic neutrinos from annihilation of WIMPs that have accumulated in the Sun and/or the Earth. Of the many WIMP candidates, perhaps the best motivated and certainly the most theoretically developed is the neutralino, the lightest superpartner in many supersymmetric theories. We review the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model and discuss prospects for detection of neutralino dark matter. We review in detail how to calculate the cosmological abundance of the neutralino and the event rates for both direct- and indirect-detection schemes, and we discuss astrophysical and laboratory constraints on supersymmetric models. We isolate and clarify the uncertainties from particle physics, nuclear physics, and astrophysics that enter at each step in the calculations. We briefly review other related dark-matter candidates and detection techniques.},

  abstract = {We report on our search for microlensing toward the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Analysis of 5.7 yr of photometry on 11.9 million stars in the LMC reveals 13-17 microlensing events. A detailed treatment of our detection efficiency shows that this is significantly more than the ~2-4 events expected from lensing by known stellar populations. The timescales () of the events range from 34 to 230 days. We estimate the microlensing optical depth toward the LMC from events with 2 &lt;  &lt; 400 days to be τ = 1.2 × 10-7, with an additional 20\% to 30\% of systematic error. The spatial distribution of events is mildly inconsistent with LMC/LMC disk self-lensing, but is consistent with an extended lens distribution such as a Milky Way or LMC halo. Interpreted in the context of a Galactic dark matter halo, consisting partially of compact objects, a maximum-likelihood analysis gives a MACHO halo fraction of 20\% for a typical halo model with a 95\% confidence interval of 8\%-50\%. A 100\% MACHO halo is ruled out at the 95\% confidence level for all except our most extreme halo model. Interpreted as a Galactic halo population, the most likely MACHO mass is between 0.15 and 0.9 M☉, depending on the halo model, and the total mass in MACHOs out to 50 kpc is found to be 9 × 1010 M☉, independent of the halo model. These results are marginally consistent with our previous results, but are lower by about a factor of 2. This is mostly due to Poisson noise, because with 3.4 times more exposure and increased sensitivity to long-timescale events, we did not find the expected factor of ~4 more events. In addition to a larger data set, this work also includes an improved efficiency determination, improved likelihood analysis, and more thorough testing of systematic errors, especially with respect to the treatment of potential backgrounds to microlensing. We note that an important source of background are supernovae (SNe) in galaxies behind the LMC.},

  abstract = {We estimate the contribution of massive compact halo objects (MACHOs) and their stellar progenitors to the mass density of the Universe. If the MACHOs that have been detected reside in the halo of our Galaxy, then a simple extrapolation of the Galactic population (out to 50 kpc) of MACHOs to cosmic scales gives a cosmic density ϱMACHO=(1–5)×109 hM⊙Mpc−3, which in terms of the critical density corresponds to ΩMACHO = (0.0036-0.017)h−1. Should the MACHO halo extend out to much further than 50 kpc, then ΩMACHO would only be larger. Such a mass density is comparable to the cosmic baryon density implied by Big Bang nucleosynthesis. If we take the central values of the estimates, then MACHOs dominate the baryonic content of the Universe today, with ΩMACHOΩB∼0.7 h. However, the cumulative uncertainties in the density determinations only require that ΩMACHOΩB ≥ 16hfgal′, where the fraction of galaxies that contain MACHOs fgal>;0.17 and h is the Hubble constant in units of 100 km s−1 Mpc−1. Our best estimate for ΩMACHO is hard to reconcile with the current best estimates of the baryonic content of the intergalactic medium indicated by measurements of the Lyman-α forest; however, measurements of ΩLyα are at present uncertain, so that such a comparison may be premature. If the MACHOs are white dwarfs resulting from a single burst of star formation (without recycling), then their main sequence progenitors would have been at least twice more massive: Ω∗ = (0.007-0.034)h−1. Thus, far too much gaseous baryonic material would remain in the Galaxy unless there is a Galactic wind to eject it. Indeed a MACHO population of white dwarfs and the gas ejected from their main sequence progenitors accounts for a significant fraction of all baryons. This fact must be taken into account when attempting to dilute the chemical by-products of such a large population of intermediate mass stars. We stress the difficulty of reconciling the MACHO mass budget with the accompanying carbon production in the case of white dwarfs. In the simplest picture, even if the excess carbon is ejected from the Galaxy by a Galactic wind, measurements of carbon abundances in Lyman α forest lines with values 10−2 solar require that only about 10−2 of all baryons can have passed through the white dwarf progenitors. Such a fraction can barely be accommodated by our estimates of ΩMACHO and would be in conflict with Ω∗.},

  abstract = {We investigate the effect of nonevaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) on the ionization and thermal history of the universe. X-rays emitted by gas accretion onto PBHs modify the cosmic recombination history, producing measurable effects on the spectrum and anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). Using the third-year WMAP data and COBE FIRAS data we improve existing upper limits on the abundance of PBHs with masses &gt;0.1 M☉ by several orders of magnitude. The new upper limits still allow PBHs to be important for the origin of supermassive black holes and ultraluminous X-ray sources. Fitting WMAP3 data with cosmological models that do not allow for nonstandard recombination histories, as produced by PBHs or other early energy sources, may lead to an underestimate of the best-fit values of the amplitude of linear density fluctuations (σ8) and the scalar spectral index (ns). Cosmological parameter estimates are affected because models with PBHs allow for larger values of the Thomson scattering optical depth, whose correlation with other parameters may not be correctly taken into account when PBHs are ignored. Values of τe ∼ 0.2, ns ∼ 1, and σ8 ∼ 0.9 are allowed at 95\% CF. This result may relieve recent tension between WMAP3 data and clusters data on the value of σ8. PBHs may increase the primordial molecular hydrogen abundance by up to 2 orders of magnitude, this promoting cooling and star formation. The suppression of galaxy formation due to X-ray heating is negligible for models consistent with the CMB data. Thus, the formation rate of the first galaxies and stars would be enhanced by a population of PBHs.},

  abstract = {Axions comprise a broad class of particles that can play a major role in explaining the unknown aspects of cosmology. They are also well-motivated within high energy physics, appearing in theories related to CP-violation in the standard model, supersymmetric theories, and theories with extra-dimensions, including string theory, and so axion cosmology offers us a unique view onto these theories. I review the motivation and models for axions in particle physics and string theory. I then present a comprehensive and pedagogical view on the cosmology and astrophysics of axion-like particles, starting from inflation and progressing via BBN, the CMB, reionization and structure formation, up to the present-day Universe. Topics covered include: axion dark matter (DM); direct and indirect detection of axions, reviewing existing and future experiments; axions as dark radiation; axions and the cosmological constant problem; decays of heavy axions; axions and stellar astrophysics; black hole superradiance; axions and astrophysical magnetic fields; axion inflation, and axion DM as an indirect probe of inflation. A major focus is on the population of ultralight axions created via vacuum realignment, and its role as a DM candidate with distinctive phenomenology. Cosmological observations place robust constraints on the axion mass and relic density in this scenario, and I review where such constraints come from. I next cover aspects of galaxy formation with axion DM, and ways this can be used to further search for evidence of axions. An absolute lower bound on DM particle mass is established. It is ma>10−24eV from linear observables, extending to ma≳10−22eV from non-linear observables, and has the potential to reach ma≳10−18eV in the future. These bounds are weaker if the axion is not all of the DM, giving rise to limits on the relic density at low mass. This leads to the exciting possibility that the effects of axion DM on structure formation could one day be detected, and the axion mass and relic density measured from cosmological observables.},

In the past, the leading particle candidates were cold and collisionless, and typically predicted missing energy signals at particle colliders. However, recent progress has greatly expanded the list of well-motivated candidates and the possible signatures of dark matter. This review begins with a brief summary of the standard model of particle physics and its outstanding problems. I then discuss several dark matter candidates motivated by these problems, including weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs), superWIMPs, light gravitinos, hidden dark matter, sterile neutrinos, and axions. For each of these, I critically examine the particle physics motivations and present their expected production mechanisms, basic properties, and implications for direct and indirect detection, particle colliders, and astrophysical observations. Upcoming experiments will discover or exclude many of these candidates, and progress may open up an era of unprecedented synergy between studies of the largest and smallest observable length scales.},

KK number is violated by loop effects because of the orbifold imposed to reproduce the chiral Standard Model with zero modes, however, a KK parity remains at any order in perturbation theory which leads to the existence of a stable lightest KK particle (LKP). In addition, the degeneracy in the KK spectrum is lifted by radiative corrections so that all other KK particles eventually decay into the LKP. We investigate cases where the Standard Model lives in five or six dimensions with compactification radius of TeV−1 size and the LKP is the first massive state in the KK tower of either the photon or the neutrino. We derive the relic density of the LKP under a variety of assumptions about the spectrum of first tier KK modes. We find that both the KK photon and the KK neutrino, with masses at the TeV scale, may have appropriate annihilation cross sections to account for the dark matter, ΩM∼0.3.},

This article reviews the concepts of direct detection of dark matter in the form of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles in ultra-sensitive detectors located in underground laboratories, discusses the expected signatures, detector concepts, and how the stringent low-background requirements are achieved. Finally, it summarizes the current status of the field and provides an outlook on the years to come.},

  abstract = {We calculate rates for the inelastic scattering of dark matter particles X on nuclei to produce low-lying excited nuclear states. Assuming a maxwellian velocity distribution for the dark matter particles X, the inelastic two-body phase space suppresses all rates by factors > 10 for mx⩽100 GeV unless the excitation energy ΔE<100 keV. We catalogue all stable nuclei with excited states in this range, and we estimate inelastic scattering matrix elements by relating them to M1 transitions, after correcting for internal conversions. Our calculated rates are typically ≲ 10−4 events/kg·day, with the least unfavourable rates being for 16969Tm and 18775Os. Problems of natural radioactivity and expense disfavour these and many other materials, leaving 12753I, 18374W and 20180Hg as the least unpromising isotopes.},

  abstract  = {This report provides an extensive review of the experimental programme of direct detection searches of particle dark matter. It focuses mostly on European efforts, both current and planned, but does it within a broader context of a worldwide activity in the field. It aims at identifying the virtues, opportunities and challenges associated with the different experimental approaches and search techniques. It presents scientific and technological synergies, both existing and emerging, with some other areas of particle physics, notably collider and neutrino programmes, and beyond. It addresses the issue of infrastructure in light of the growing needs and challenges of the different experimental searches. Finally, the report makes a number of recommendations from the perspective of a long-term future of the field. They are introduced, along with some justification, in the opening overview and recommendations section and are next summarised at the end of the report. Overall, we recommend that the direct search for dark matter particle interactions with a detector target should be given top priority in astroparticle physics, and in all particle physics, and beyond, as a positive measurement will provide the most unambiguous confirmation of the particle nature of dark matter in the Universe.},

  abstract  = {Dark Matter (DM) as a weakly interacting massive particle could annihilate or decay and give rise to high energy gamma-rays. Then an indirect search for Dark Matter is possible by means of the Large Area Telescope on board the Fermi satellite. A relatively large signal is expected from the regions where the Dark Matter is expected to have the greatest density, such as the central region of the Milky Way. This region also hosts many high-energy gamma ray sources, of many different classes. Furthermore diffuse gamma-ray emission due to cosmic-ray interactions with interstellar gas and radiation is detected from the same direction. A greatly improved understanding of the gamma ray emission from the Galactic Center region is going to be obtained with the Fermi LAT first-year data. The data along with refined modelling of the diffuse emission and a careful evaluation of the discrete sources will improve our ability to disentangle a potential dark matter signal from the astrophysical background and to place new limits on the mass and annihilation rate (or lifetime) of Dark Matter particles},

These   limits improve on previously published Fermi-LAT and MAGIC results by up   to a factor of two at certain masses.

  abstract  = {The Standard Solar Model (SSM) is an important reference in Astrophysics as the Sun stays today the most observed star. This model is used to predict the internal observables like neutrino fluxes and oscillation frequencies and consequently to validate its assumptions for its generalization to other stars. The model outputs result from the resolution of the classical stellar equations and the knowledge of fundamental physics like nuclear reaction rates, screening, photon interaction, plasma physics. The plasma conditions remained unmeasurable in laboratory for long due to the high temperature and high density conditions of the solar interior. Today, neutrino detections and helioseismology aboard SoHO have largely revealed the solar interior, in particular the nuclear solar core so one can estimate the reliability of SSM and also its coherence with the different indicators and between them. This has been possible thanks to a Seismic Solar Model (SeSM) which takes into account in addition the observed sound speed profile. Seismology quantifies also some internal dynamical processes that need to be properly introduced in the description of stars. This review describes the different steps of building of the SSM, its predictions and the comparisons with observations. It discusses the accuracy of such model compared to the accuracy of the SeSM. The noticed differences and observational constraints put some limits on other possible processes like dark matter, magnetic field or waves and determine the directions of progress for the near future that will come from precise emitted neutrino fluxes. High density laser facilities promise also unprecedented checks of energy transfer by photons and nuclear reaction rates.},

  abstract      = {Muons created by  charged current (CC) interactions in the water surrounding the ANTARES neutrino telescope have been almost exclusively used so far in searches for cosmic neutrino sources. Due to their long range, highly energetic muons inducing Cherenkov radiation in the water are reconstructed with dedicated algorithms that allow for the determination of the parent neutrino direction with a median angular resolution of about 0.°4 for an  neutrino spectrum. In this paper, an algorithm optimized for accurate reconstruction of energy and direction of shower events in the ANTARES detector is presented. Hadronic showers of electrically charged particles are produced by the disintegration of the nucleus both in CC and neutral current interactions of neutrinos in water. In addition, electromagnetic showers result from the CC interactions of electron neutrinos while the decay of a tau lepton produced in  CC interactions will, in most cases, lead to either a hadronic or an electromagnetic shower. A shower can be approximated as a point source of photons. With the presented method, the shower position is reconstructed with a precision of about 1 m; the neutrino direction is reconstructed with a median angular resolution between 2° and 3° in the energy range of 1–1000 TeV. In this energy interval, the uncertainty on the reconstructed neutrino energy is about 5\%–10\%. The increase in the detector sensitivity due to the use of additional information from shower events in the searches for a cosmic neutrino flux is also presented.},

It consists of a three-dimensional array of optical modules, each containing a large photomultiplier tube. A total of 2700 front-end ASICs named analogue ring samplers (ARS) process the phototube signals, measure their arrival time, amplitude and shape as well as perform monitoring and calibration tasks. The ARS chip processes the analogue signals from the optical modules and converts information into digital data. All the information is transmitted to shore through further multiplexing electronics and an optical link. This paper describes the performance of the ARS chip; results from the functionality and characterization tests in the laboratory are summarized and the long-term performance in the apparatus is illustrated.},

  abstract      = {ANTARES is a project leading towards the construction and deployment of a neutrino telescope in the deep Mediterranean Sea. The telescope will use an array of photomultiplier tubes to detect the Cherenkov light emitted by muons resulting from the interaction with matter of high energy neutrinos. In the vicinity of the deployment site the ANTARES Collaboration has performed a series of in situ measurements to study the change in light transmission through glass surfaces during immersions of several months. The average loss of light transmission is estimated to be only ∼2\% at the equator of a glass sphere one year after deployment. It decreases with increasing zenith angle, and tends to saturate with time. The transmission loss, therefore, is expected to remain small for the several year lifetime of the ANTARES detector whose optical modules are oriented downwards. The measurements were complemented by the analysis of the 210Pb activity profile in sediment cores and the study of biofouling on glass plates. Despite a significant sedimentation rate at the site, in the 0.02–0.05 cmyr−1 range, the sediments adhere loosely to the glass surfaces and can be washed off by water currents. Further, fouling by deposits of light-absorbing particulates is only significant for surfaces facing upwards.},

  abstract      = {The deep ocean is the largest and least known ecosystem on Earth. It hosts numerous pelagic organisms, most of which are able to emit light. Here we present a unique data set consisting of a 2.5-year long record of light emission by deep-sea pelagic organisms, measured from December 2007 to June 2010 at the ANTARES underwater neutrino telescope in the deep NW Mediterranean Sea, jointly with synchronous hydrological records. This is the longest continuous time-series of deep-sea bioluminescence ever recorded. Our record reveals several weeks long, seasonal bioluminescence blooms with light intensity up to two orders of magnitude higher than background values, which correlate to changes in the properties of deep waters. Such changes are triggered by the winter cooling and evaporation experienced by the upper ocean layer in the Gulf of Lion that leads to the formation and subsequent sinking of dense water through a process known as “open-sea convection”. It episodically renews the deep water of the study area and conveys fresh organic matter that fuels the deep ecosystems. Luminous bacteria most likely are the main contributors to the observed deep-sea bioluminescence blooms. Our observations demonstrate a consistent and rapid connection between deep open-sea convection and bathypelagic biological activity, as expressed by bioluminescence. In a setting where dense water formation events are likely to decline under global warming scenarios enhancing ocean stratification, in situ observatories become essential as environmental sentinels for the monitoring and understanding of deep-sea ecosystem shifts.},

  abstract      = {The Antares neutrino telescope is a large photomultiplier array designed to detect neutrino-induced upward-going muons by their Cherenkov radiation. Understanding the absorption and scattering of light in the deep Mediterranean is fundamental to optimising the design and performance of the detector. This paper presents measurements of blue and UV light transmission at the Antares site taken between 1997 and 2000. The derived values for the scattering length and the angular distribution of particulate scattering were found to be highly correlated, and results are therefore presented in terms of an absorption length λabs and an effective scattering length λscteff. The values for blue (UV) light are found to be λabs≃60(26)m, λscteff≃265(122)m, with significant (∼15\%) time variability. Finally, the results of Antares simulations showing the effect of these water properties on the anticipated performance of the detector are presented.},

  abstract = {Neutrino telescopes will open, in the next years, new opportunities in observational high energy astrophysics. In these detectors, atmospheric muons from primary cosmic ray interactions in the atmosphere play an important role, because they provide the most abundant source of events for calibration and test. On the other side, they represent the major background source. In this paper a fast Monte Carlo generator (called MUPAGE) of bundles of atmospheric muons for underwater/ice neutrino telescopes is presented. MUPAGE is based on parametric formulas [Y. Becherini, A. Margiotta, M. Sioli, M. Spurio, Astrop. Phys. 25 (2006) 1] obtained from a full Monte Carlo simulation of cosmic ray showers generating muons in bundle, which are propagated down to 5 km w.e. It produces the event kinematics on the surface of a user-defined cylinder, surrounding the virtual detector. The multiplicity of the muons in the bundle, the muon lateral distribution and energy spectrum are simulated according to a specific model of primary cosmic ray flux, with constraints from measurements of the muon flux with underground experiments. As an example of application, the result of the generation of events on a cylindrical surface of ∼1.4 km2 at a depth of 2450 m of water is presented.

The angular deviation and lateral displacement of muons due to multiple scattering, as well as bremsstrahlung, pair production and inelastic scattering are taken into account. The code has been applied to obtain the energy distribution and angular and lateral deviations of single muons at different depths underground. The muon multiplicity distributions obtained with MUSIC and CORSIKA (Extensive Air Shower simulation code) are also presented. We discuss the systematic uncertainties of the results due to different muon bremsstrahlung cross-sections.},

  abstract = {The data collected by ATIC, CREAM and PAMELA all display remarkable cosmic ray nuclei spectrum hardening above the magnetic rigidity ∼240 GV. One natural speculation is that the primary electron spectrum also gets hardened (possibly at ∼80 GV) and the hardening partly accounts for the electron/positron total spectrum excess discovered by ATIC, HESS and Fermi-LAT. If it is the case, the increasing behavior of the subsequent positron-to-electron ratio will get flattened and the spectrum hardening should be taken into account in the joint fit of the electron/positron data otherwise the inferred parameters will be biased. Our joint fits of the latest AMS-02 positron fraction data together with the PAMELA/Fermi-LAT electron/positron spectrum data suggest that the primary electron spectrum hardening is needed in most though not all modelings. The bounds on dark matter models have also been investigated. In the presence of spectrum hardening of primary electrons, the amount of dark-matter-originated electron/positron pairs needed in the modeling is smaller. Even with such a modification, the annihilation channel χχ→μ+μ− has been tightly constrained by the Fermi-LAT Galactic diffuse emission data. The decay channel χ→μ+μ− is found to be viable.},

  abstract      = {We present results from an analysis looking for dark matter annihilation in the Sun with the IceCube neutrino telescope. Gravitationally trapped dark matter in the Sun's core can annihilate into Standard Model particles making the Sun a source of  GeV neutrinos. IceCube is able to detect neutrinos with energies >100 GeV while its low-energy infill array DeepCore extends this to >10 GeV. This analysis uses data gathered in the austral winters between May 2011 and May 2014, corresponding to 532 days of livetime when the Sun, being below the horizon, is a source of up-going neutrino events, easiest to discriminate against the dominant background of atmospheric muons. The sensitivity is a factor of two to four better than previous searches due to additional statistics and improved analysis methods involving better background rejection and reconstructions. The resultant upper limits on the spin-dependent dark matter-proton scattering cross section reach down to {\$}{\$}1.46{\backslash}times 10^{\{}-5{\}}{\$}{\$} pb for a dark matter particle of mass 500 GeV annihilating exclusively into {\$}{\$}{\backslash}tau ^{\{}+{\}}{\backslash}tau ^{\{}-{\}}{\$}{\$}particles. These are currently the most stringent limits on the spin-dependent dark matter-proton scattering cross section for WIMP masses above 50 GeV.},

  abstract = {This article is concerned with the approximation and expressive powers of deep neural networks. This is an active research area currently producing many interesting papers. The results most commonly found in the literature prove that neural networks approximate functions with classical smoothness to the same accuracy as classical linear methods of approximation, e.g., approximation by polynomials or by piecewise polynomials on prescribed partitions. However, approximation by neural networks depending on n parameters is a form of nonlinear approximation and as such should be compared with other nonlinear methods such as variable knot splines or n-term approximation from dictionaries. The performance of neural networks in targeted applications such as machine learning indicate that they actually possess even greater approximation power than these traditional methods of nonlinear approximation. The main results of this article prove that this is indeed the case. This is done by exhibiting large classes of functions which can be efficiently captured by neural networks where classical nonlinear methods fall short of the task. The present article purposefully limits itself to studying the approximation of univariate functions by ReLU networks. Many generalizations to functions of several variables and other activation functions can be envisioned. However, even in this simplest of settings considered here, a theory that completely quantifies the approximation power of neural networks is still lacking.},

  abstract      = {The ANTARES neutrino telescope, located 40 km off the coast of Toulon in the Mediterranean Sea at a mooring depth of about 2475 m, consists of twelve detection  lines equipped typically with 25 storeys. Every storey carries three optical modules that detect Cherenkov light induced by charged secondary particles (typically muons) coming from neutrino interactions. As these lines are flexible structures fixed to the sea bed and held taut by a buoy, sea currents cause the lines to move and the storeys to rotate.  The knowledge of the position of the optical modules with a precision better than 10 cm is essential for a good reconstruction of particle tracks. In this paper the ANTARES positioning system is described. It consists of an acoustic positioning system, for distance triangulation, and a compass-tiltmeter system, for the measurement of the orientation and inclination of the storeys. Necessary corrections are discussed and the results of the detector alignment procedure are described.},

Long term exploration of a 3500 m deep site in the Mediterranean close to the Sicilian coast has shown that it is optimal for the installation of the detector. A complete feasibility study, that has considered all the components of the detector as well as its deployment, has been carried out demonstrating that technological solutions exist for the realization of the km3 detector. The realization of a technological demonstrator (the NEMO Phase 1 project) is under way.},

  abstract      = {Next-generation neutrino telescopes with substantially improved sensitivity are required to pinpoint the sources of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux detected by IceCube and uncover the century-old puzzle of cosmic-ray origins. A detector near the Equator will provide a unique viewpoint of the neutrino sky, complementing IceCube and other neutrino telescopes in the Northern Hemisphere. Here we present results from an expedition to the northeastern region of the South China Sea, in the western Pacific Ocean. A favourable neutrino telescope site was found on an abyssal plain at a depth of {\textasciitilde}3.5{\thinspace}km. At depths below 3{\thinspace}km, the sea current speed, water absorption and scattering lengths for Cherenkov light were measured to be vc{\thinspace}<{\thinspace}10{\thinspace}cm{\thinspace}s−1, $\lambda$abs{\thinspace}≈{\thinspace}27{\thinspace}m and $\lambda$sca{\thinspace}≈{\thinspace}63{\thinspace}m, respectively. Accounting for these measurements, we present the design and expected performance of a next-generation neutrino telescope, Tropical Deep-sea Neutrino Telescope (TRIDENT). With its advanced photon-detection technology and large dimensions, TRIDENT expects to observe the IceCube steady source candidate NGC{\thinspace}1068 with 5$\sigma$ significance within 1{\thinspace}year of operation. This level of sensitivity will open a new arena for diagnosing the origin of cosmic rays and probing fundamental physics over astronomical baselines.},
